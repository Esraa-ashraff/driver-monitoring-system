## 📌 Project Overview
The system utilizes Computer Vision and Deep Learning to analyze driver behavior in real-time. It is specifically engineered to handle complex real-world variables that often challenge standard monitoring models.

### Core Detection Capabilities:
- **Drowsiness Detection:** Real-time monitoring of eye closure duration with immediate alerts.
- **Distraction Tracking:** Precise 3D head pose estimation (Looking Left, Right, Up, or Down).
- **Environmental Robustness:** High-accuracy performance even when the driver is wearing **Masks** or **Glasses**.

## 🎯 Features
* **YOLOv8 Multi-Model Pipeline:** Integration of 3 specialized YOLOv8 models for Face Mask, Glasses, and Eye Status detection.
* **3D Head Pose Estimation:** Leverages MediaPipe Face Mesh and PnP (Perspective-n-Point) algorithm for accurate orientation tracking.
* **Intelligent Alert System:** Instant audio warnings via `pygame` triggered by time-based thresholds to minimize false positives.
* **High Performance:** Optimized for real-time processing with high FPS (Frames Per Second) stability.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Programming:** Python
* **AI/ML:** YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), MediaPipe
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, NumPy
* **Audio Processing:** Pygame (Mixer)
* **Mathematics:** 3D Projection Matrices & Euclidean Distance

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Esraa-ashraff/driver-monitoring-system.git](https://github.com/Esraa-ashraff/driver-monitoring-system.git)
cd driver-monitoring-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

### 2. Running the Project
Ensure your camera is connected and the model, sound files are located in the same folder of the code, then execute:

```bash
python Code/main.py
```
---

---

## 📊 Results & Demo
The system classifies driver states into 5 distinct categories for maximum safety coverage: 

* **Face Detected:** Normal driving state (Forward-facing).
* **Face with Glasses:** Successful tracking while wearing eyewear.
* **Face with Mask:** Accurate eye tracking optimized for masked faces.
* **Face with Mask and Glasses:** Handling complex overlapping conditions.
* **No Face Detected:** Immediate warning triggered when no face is visible to the camera.
